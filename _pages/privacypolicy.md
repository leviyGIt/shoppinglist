# ShopList Privacy Policy
ShopList (“we”, “our”, or “us”) helps households plan smarter grocery runs by keeping collaborative lists, reminders, and pantry insights in sync across devices. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and the choices you have when you use the ShopList mobile application and companion landing page (collectively, the “Services”).

If you ever have questions about this policy, email us at [support@shoplist.app](mailto:support@shoplist.app).

## 1. Information we collect
We designed ShopList so you can get value without creating an account. To power optional features, we may collect:

### 1.1 Information you provide
- **List content.** Items, notes, categories, and reminders you manually add to your grocery lists.
- **Photos & barcodes (optional).** When you attach a photo or scan a barcode to add an item, we access your device camera only for that action. Images remain on your device unless you choose to sync them.
- **Shared contacts (optional).** If you grant Contacts access, we read the selected contact names/email addresses so you can invite them to collaborate. We do not upload your full address book.

### 1.2 Information collected automatically
- **Device data.** Basic diagnostic information (device model, OS version, app version) to troubleshoot crashes and ensure compatibility.
- **Usage analytics.** Anonymous event data (e.g., feature usage, screen flow) that helps us understand which features are helpful and where to improve the experience. These analytics never include list contents.

---

## 2. How we use information
- **Provide core functionality.** Sync lists, reminders, and favorites across your devices.
- **Enable optional features.** Camera access lets you capture photos/barcodes; contacts access powers list sharing.
- **Improve ShopList.** Analytics and crash diagnostics help us prioritize roadmap work and fix bugs faster.
- **Communicate with you.** We may email support responses or important service updates if you contact us first.

We never sell your personal information or list data.

## 3. Sharing and third parties
We dont use any third party servicest
---

## 4. Data retention & security
- List data stays on your device.
- Photo and barcode attachments remain on your device cache unless you explicitly share or back them up.
- Contact info used for invitations is stored only on your device as long as necessary to send or maintain that shared list connection.
- You can delete lists at any time, which removes them from our sync service within 24 hours.

---

## 5. Your choices
- **Permissions.** You can revoke camera or contacts access at any time in iOS Settings → Privacy.
- **Data deletion.** Delete lists or uninstall the app to remove locally stored data. Email [support@shoplist.app](mailto:support@shoplist.app) for additional deletion requests.
- **Opt-out of analytics.** Toggle “Share anonymous analytics” in Settings to stop sending usage diagnostics.

## 6. Children’s privacy
ShopList is intended for users 13+. We do not knowingly collect information from children under 13. If you believe a child has provided us data, contact us and we’ll delete it promptly.

---

## 7. International data transfers
Depending on your location, data may be processed on servers located outside your country. We rely on standard contractual clauses and industry security practices to protect your information.

---

## 8. Updates to this policy
We may update this policy as we add features or comply with new regulations. We’ll update the “Last updated” date above and may notify you in-app for significant changes.
